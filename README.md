PORTFOLIO:
OVERVIEW:
Whats all your skills if there's no format?
Portfolio also known as CV has become one of the most important ways to display the achievements and other skills a person beholds. With minimal skills that i bheold, here i've prepared a portfolio of mine. 

ABOUT: 
Portfolio websites generally contain all the information about a person like the education status, proffesional expereince, skills a person has, achivements and other official details. It is mostly used to give an overview of these in short. This also contains the information that will help recruiters or any other proffessionals to reach-out to the person as and when needed. The portfolio website has a higher demand in today's date.


TECH-STACKS:
I have built this mainly by using the HTML and a bit of CSS. As a beginner i deployed this and will be modifying the same as i go ahead whilst learning new tech-stacks.

RESULT:
After getting into the process of learning new stuffs I managed to create a newbie website, the glance of which you can get beneath.

CONCLUSION:
I deployed the whole project by just using HTML and CSS. There are many more stacks that could have been used in this. I'll be continuing to restructure the present one and will give it a final touch with all the required techs that are usually used in deploying a website. 

REFERENCE:
I took the help of many online reading docs to get the required structure as i wanted.
